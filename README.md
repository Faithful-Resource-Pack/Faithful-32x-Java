### Downloads:
The latest release versions can be downloaded on [our website](https://faithfulpack.net/faithful32x/latest) and the latest unreleased versions on [our database](https://database.faithfulpack.net/packs/32x-Java/Experimental/).

### Versions:
#### To view the pack files and to switch between resource pack versions, click the branch button (usually named `master` or `main`) and select the version you want to see!  
#### The `java-latest` branch is always updated to the latest Minecraft version, including snapshots/pre-releases/release candidates. It's meant for easier development, so unless you know what you're doing, just use a properly numbered branch.
